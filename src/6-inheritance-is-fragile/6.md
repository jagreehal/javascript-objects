While NOT using new is maybe a problem 

> inheritance is a bigger problem.

In my opinion favouring composition over inheritance is the only way of developing software.

Smaller (composable) components objects do one thing and one thing well.
 
They're easier to test, maintain and provide SOLID building blocks to build you software on.   

Like an alcoholic who wants to stop drinking probably has to acknowledge they have a problem in the first place.  

For example we have a camera class to take pictures and a phone class to make calls. They both have name properties and could have other shared behaviour. So we could create a Device class from which they inherit from.

Now we want to create a Smartphone this can make calls and take pictures.  

But in OO we can only inherit from one object.

We could try to fit a square peg into a round hole and do this in a class based way by creating other objects in some crazy hierarchy.

And what if someone added the functionality insert film on the camera class? Everything that desired from it including the our smartphone is affected.

And what if we only wanted to use one function from the class do we really need to new something up and get everything else we're not going to use as well.
