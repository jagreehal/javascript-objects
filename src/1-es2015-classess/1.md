##Intro 

Many JavaScript developers (including myself) have migrated from traditional class based languages such as Java or C#.

For those like me the code to create a class in ES2015 will look familiar.

Here we have a Device class with a constructor that is used to initialise the name property and a public function.

If we want to create a camera we can inherit from the Device class.

Note how we didn't need to have a constructor in the Camera class.

We can use super to call a function in the 'parent' class.

But ES6 classes are nothing but syntax sugar of what you could do in ES5.

It makes:

* 'inheritance' easier
* JavaScript look familiar
