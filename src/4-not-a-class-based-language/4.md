##Intro 

JavaScript doesn't have inheritance. Not even prototypal inheritance. There's no copying going on here. The class is not a blueprint from instance created from it.

For example we can define a class, create an instance and modify it at runtime.

It's the inverse of what happens in traditional class based languages.
	
It's better to think in terms of objects linked to other objects.

While it goes someway to take it easier for developers to transition from another languages it doesn't give them everything.  

For example there's no private variables. You have to use Symbols or WeakMaps.

And the fact you have to use new (otherwise you'll pollute the global scope) is considered to be a flaw. This doesn't matter so much for ES6 does and ES5 in strict mode because you're prevented in doing so.
