##Intro 

Many developers (including myself) using JavaScript have come from using traditional class based languages such as Java or C#.

The code to create a class in ES2015 will look familiar.

Here we have a Device class with a constructor that is used to initialise the name property, a public function that uses an instance variable.

Now if we wanted to create a camera we could inherit from the Device class like this.

Note how we didn't need to have a constructor in the Camera class.

We can use super to call a function in the class that's being inherited from.

But ES6 classes are nothing but syntax sugar of what you could do in ES5.

It makes 'inheritance' easier and enables developers to write JavaScript without having to understand the language itself.
