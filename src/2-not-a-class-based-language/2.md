##Intro 

The only inheritance that happens in JavaScript is when an object inherits from prototype (unless create you use Object.create(null)). 

A JavaScript class is not a blueprint. There's no copying going on here.  

It's the inverse of what happens in traditional class based languages.

For example we can define a class, create an instance and modify it at runtime which changes all instances of that class.

It's better to think in terms of objects linked to other objects (see [OOLO by Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes)).

While it goes someway to take it easier for developers to transition from another languages it doesn't give them everything.  

There is no private keyword so you have to modify what a constructor function returns, functions within the constructor function or use Symbols or WeakMaps.
