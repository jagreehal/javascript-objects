##Intro 

A prototype is 'inherited' by an object.

And there are many patterns how to create objects but as stated in his book Kyle Simpson says 
it's better to think of objects linked to other objects (OLOO)

See https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes

The fact you have to use new (otherwise you'll pollute the global scope) is considered to be a flaw. This doesn't matter so much for ES6 does and ES5 in strict mode because you're prevented in doing so

So can I get create objects with using new?

Using Object.create or closures are good alternatives.

But what's the cost?

Speed. There's no getting away from it when compared to anything else function constructors and prototypes perform better both in memory and speed because they can be optimised by JS engines.  

I'm sold!

Hold up.

While I'm not a game developer, I've been building web applications for many companies building solutions for a variety of JavaScript projects and I've never had to create thousands of anything.

And the reality is you would be better off looking at network or database performance before optimising object creation to get better performance.
