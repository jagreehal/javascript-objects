##Intro 

So far we've only seen creating objects using classes and constructor functions.
 
But there are lots of developers who have advised against using constructor functions and new

* Eric Elliott - Stop Using Constructor Functions In JavaScript (http://ericleads.com/2012/09/stop-using-constructor-functions-in-javascript/)

* Douglas Crockford - The Better Parts" of ES6 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGEjv3Tqo0&t=6m)

* Aadit M Shah - Why Prototypal Inheritance Matters (http://aaditmshah.github.io/why-prototypal-inheritance-matters/)

The fact you have to use new (otherwise you'll pollute the global scope) is considered to be a flaw.

This doesn't matter so much for ES2015 and ES5 in strict mode because you're prevented in doing so.

### So can I get create objects with using new?

Yes using Object.create.

I'm sold!

Hold up.

But what's the cost?

Speed. There's no getting away from it when compared to anything else function constructors and prototypes perform better both in memory and speed because they can be optimised by JS engines.  

See new [Fn(...) vs. Object.create(P)' by Vyacheslav Egorov](http://mrale.ph/blog/2014/07/30/constructor-vs-objectcreate.html).

Hang on.

While I'm not a game developer, I've been building web applications for many companies building solutions for a variety of JavaScript projects and I've never had to create thousands of anything.

And the reality is you would be better off looking at network or database performance before optimising object creation to get better performance.
