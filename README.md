## JavaScript classes and objects using ES2015 and beyond

For this talk I'm using [wallaby.js](http://wallabyjs.com/). It will change your life.
     
There are no slides :)

The code is compiled via [babel](http://babeljs.io/)

If you see any errors or have a suggestion please contact me [@jagreehal](http://twitter.com/jagreehal)

The code used in this talk is on [github](https://github.com/jagreehal/javascript-objects).

BTW - I use ES2015 syntax just like everyone else... inconsistency ;)
